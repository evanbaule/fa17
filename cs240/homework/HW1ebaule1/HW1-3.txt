Tail recursion is a method in which the compiler executes the same instructions over and over again by jumping to the beginning of the stack frame when the recursive function is called within itself. By reusing the instructions, it can avoid building a stack frame for the internal function call by using the one that is already there. This is efficient because there is only 1 stack frame created, rather than creating a nested stack frame for each function call. In a memory-restricted system, this could be helpful in avoiding stack oveflows.
