	Need to add:
		Safeguard against infinite loop
		Safeguard against performing commands on a donor object that doesnt exit
		Safeguard against improper format of inputs
		Need to fix why cin doesn't want to take floats with decimals
			.xx drops into loop
			x.xx cannot be interpreted and throws not recognized command
		Change to input from text file
			open stream from file -> input line by line from *FILE
